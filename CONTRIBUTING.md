Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [documentation](https://seomarket.ru/documentation)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [search](https://github.com/KyrlanAlanAlexandre/seomarket/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain SeoMarket's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible SeoMarket

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
